MentalHealthDesignSystem is a comprehensive UI component library designed specifically for mental health applications. This project leverages the power of Angular and Storybook to create reusable, testable, and visually appealing components that enhance the user experience for both patients and healthcare providers.

## Key Features

- **Angular CLI**: Built with Angular CLI version 18.2.3, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture.

## Storybook

Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation for Angular projects. It allows you to create and showcase components independently, making it easier to develop, test, and document them. 

To start Storybook, run `npm run storybook`. This will launch the Storybook server and open a new tab in your browser at `http://localhost:6006/`, where you can view and interact with your components.
